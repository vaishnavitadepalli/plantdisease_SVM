# plantdisease_SVM 
Disease detection involves the steps - Image Acquisition, Image Pre-processing, Image Segmentation, Feature extraction and Classification.
Our main goal is to construct a model which can detect a leaf in an image and to to evaluate the performance of model with different ML algorithms on our PlantVillage Dataset



An accuracy of 97% was achieved using Random Forest Classifier.,
As the disease situation becomes gradually complex, the number of errors gradually increases because when the disease becomes more serious, the characteristic parameters will become more complex, which will make the results unstable
