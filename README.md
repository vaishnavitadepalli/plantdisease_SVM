Disease detection involves the steps - 
Image Acquisition
Image Pre-processing
Image Segmentation 
Feature extraction 
Classification.
Our main goal is to construct a model which can detect a leaf in an image and to to evaluate the performance of model with different ML algorithms on our PlantVillage Dataset

DATASET Description:
1)The PlantVillage dataset(PVD)  is the only public dataset for plant disease detection to the best of our knowledge.
2)The images in PlantVillage dataset are taken in laboratory setups and not in the real conditions of cultivation fields, due to which their efficacy in real world is likely to be poor.

An accuracy of 97% was achieved using Random Forest Classifier.,
As the disease situation becomes gradually complex, the number of errors gradually increases because when the disease becomes more serious, the characteristic parameters will become more complex, which will make the results unstable
